### Welcome!

My Name is Darius and I am an aspiring ASP.Net Full Stack Developer. I am currently working on a project called Insectic to help visualize "unplanned work". I decided to work on this project to increase my skills in all my known languages such as c#, SQL, HTML, CSS. The project was inspired by the Phoneix Project by Gene Kim, Kevin Behr, and George Spafford.
